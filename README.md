# 🎣 GPO Autofish - GUIDE

**💬 Join our Discord server:** https://discord.gg/unPZxXAtfb

## What is this?

This is the **open-source version** of the GPO fishing macro that everyone uses. Unlike the closed-source version that gets flagged as a virus and isn't trustworthy, this version is:

- ✅ **Fully open source** - You can see and verify all the code
- ✅ **No viruses** - Clean, transparent, and safe
- ✅ **Improved** - Better features and reliability
- ✅ **Community-driven** - Open for contributions and review

The original closed-source macro is sketchy and often flagged by antivirus software because you can't verify what it's actually doing. This open-source version solves that problem.

**🛡️ Concerned about safety? Read [IS_IT_A_VIRUS.md](IS_IT_A_VIRUS.md) for more information.**
