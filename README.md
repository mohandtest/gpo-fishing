# 🎣 GPO Autofish - GUIDE

**💬 Join our Discord server:** https://discord.gg/unPZxXAtfb

## What is this?

This is the **open-source version** of the GPO fishing macro that everyone uses. Unlike the closed-source version that gets flagged as a virus and isn't trustworthy, this version is:

- ✅ **Fully open source** - You can see and verify all the code
- ✅ **No viruses** - Clean, transparent, and safe
- ✅ **Improved** - Better features and reliability
- ✅ **Community-driven** - Open for contributions and review

The original closed-source macro is sketchy and often flagged by antivirus software because you can't verify what it's actually doing. This open-source version solves that problem.

## Installation

### ⚠️ Python Version Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: This application requires **Python 3.12 or 3.13**.

- ❌ **Python 3.14+ is NOT supported** due to compatibility issues with required packages (EasyOCR, PyTorch, etc.)
- ✅ **Recommended**: Python 3.13.0 (most stable)
- ✅ **Alternative**: Python 3.12.7

**Download Links:**

- [Python 3.13.0](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.0/python-3.13.0-amd64.exe) (Recommended)
- [Python 3.12.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.7/python-3.12.7-amd64.exe) (Alternative)

### 🚀 Easy Installation (Recommended)

1. **Install Python 3.12 or 3.13** (see links above) - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
2. **Download the repository** as ZIP and extract it
3. **Double-click `install.bat`** - This will:
   - Check if Python is installed and verify version compatibility
   - Install all required packages automatically
   - Set everything up for you
4. **Run the application:**
   - **Standard mode:** Double-click `run.bat` (silent, no console)
   - **Dev mode:** Double-click `run_dev.bat` (with console for debugging)

### 🔧 Manual Installation

1. **Install Python 3.12 or 3.13** from the links above (check "Add to PATH")
   - ⚠️ **Do NOT use Python 3.14+** - it will cause installation failures
2. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arielldev/gpo-autofish.git
   cd gpo-autofish
   ```
3. **Install packages**
   ```bash

   ```
4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## 🎮 Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Install**: Run `install.bat` to set everything up automatically
2. **Launch**: Use `run.bat` (silent mode) or `run_dev.bat` (with console for debugging)
3. **Configure Layouts**: Position overlays over fishing bar and drop detection areas
4. **Set Points**: Configure fruit storage points and auto-purchase coordinates
5. **Enable Features**: Turn on devil fruit storage, webhooks, and auto-purchase as needed

### Devil Fruit Storage Setup

1. **Enable Fruit Storage**: Check the "Enable Fruit Storage" option
2. **Set Fruit Key**: Choose which inventory slot (1-9) to store fruits
3. **Set Fruit Point**: Click to set where to click for fruit selection
4. **Set Rod Key**: Choose which slot (1-9) contains your fishing rod
5. **Set Bait Point**: Click to set where to click for bait selection

### Discord Webhook Setup

1. **Create Webhook**: In your Discord server → Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
2. **Copy URL**: Paste the webhook URL in the bot settings
3. **Configure Alerts**:
   - 🍎 Devil Fruit Catch Alerts - Notifications when you catch a fruit while fishing
   - 🌟 Devil Fruit Spawn Alerts - Notifications when fruits spawn in the world (with exact fruit name)
   - 🐟 Fish Progress Updates - Regular progress reports
   - 🛒 Auto Purchase Alerts - Bait purchase confirmations
4. **Set Interval**: Choose how often to send fish progress updates

### Hotkeys

- **F1**: Start/Stop fishing loop
- **F2**: Toggle layout overlay
- **F3**: Emergency stop and exit
- **F4**: Minimize to system tray
- **Note**: All hotkeys work without admin privileges

### Performance Tips

- **Long Sessions**: Use `run.bat` for extended fishing sessions (runs silently in background)
- **Debugging**: Use `run_dev.bat` when you need to see console output or troubleshoot issues
- **Webhook Monitoring**: Use Discord alerts for fruit spawns and catches instead of watching console
- **OCR Optimization**: Ensure good lighting and clear text for better fruit detection
- **Spawn Detection**: The bot detects all 33 GPO devil fruits automatically using fuzzy matching

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

- **"Python not found"**: Download Python 3.12 or 3.13 from the links above and check "Add to PATH"
- **"Python 3.14+ not supported"**: Uninstall Python 3.14+ and install Python 3.13 or 3.12 instead
- **"pip not recognized"**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- **Permission errors**: Right-click `install.bat` → "Run as administrator"
- **Package installation failures**: Ensure you're using Python 3.12 or 3.13, not 3.14+

### Runtime Issues

- **Hotkeys not working**: Try running with administrator privileges
- **Fish detection failing**: Adjust overlay position over the blue fishing bar
- **Devil fruit not detected**: Check OCR setup and drop area positioning
- **Fruit spawns not detected**: Ensure drop layout covers the spawn message area
- **Auto-purchase failing**: Verify all 4 purchase points are set correctly
- **High CPU usage**: Use `run.bat` for silent mode operation

### Devil Fruit Issues

- **Fruits not being stored**: Check if OCR detected the fruit in console logs
- **Storage sequence running without fruit**: Ensure OCR is working properly
- **Wrong inventory slot**: Verify fruit key setting matches your setup
- **Rod not switching back**: Check rod key and bait point configuration

### Performance Issues

- **Long sessions lagging**: Use `run.bat` for silent background operation
- **Need console output**: Use `run_dev.bat` for debugging mode with full logging
- **Memory usage**: Standard mode (`run.bat`) automatically reduces memory footprint
- **OCR slow**: Install EasyOCR properly for faster text recognition
- **Spawn detection**: Works automatically for all 33 GPO fruits with fuzzy name matching

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase has been refactored into a clean, modular structure:

```
src/
├── main.py              # Application entry poi
├── gui.py               # Main GUI and UI components
├── fishing.py           # Fishing bot logic and devil fruit detection
├── overlay.py           # Overlay window management
├── layout_manager.py    # Layout switching and area management
├── zoom_controller.py   # Auto zoom control system
├── ocr_manager.py       # OCR text recognition for devil fruits
├── webhook.py           # Discord webhook integration
├── updater.py           # Auto-update system
