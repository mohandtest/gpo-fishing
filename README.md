# 🎣 GPO Autofish - GUIDE

**💬 Join our Discord server:** https://discord.gg/unPZxXAtfb

## What is this?

This is the **open-source version** of the GPO fishing macro that everyone uses. Unlike the closed-source version that gets flagged as a virus and isn't trustworthy, this version is:

- ✅ **Fully open source** - You can see and verify all the code
- ✅ **No viruses** - Clean, transparent, and safe
- ✅ **Improved** - Better features and reliability
- ✅ **Community-driven** - Open for contributions and review

The original closed-source macro is sketchy and often flagged by antivirus software because you can't verify what it's actually doing. This open-source version solves that problem.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

- **"Python not found"**: Download from https://python.org and check "Add to PATH"
- **"pip not recognized"**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- **Permission errors**: Right-click `install.bat` → "Run as administrator"

### Runtime Issues

- **Hotkeys not working**: Try running with administrator privileges
- **Fish detection failing**: Adjust overlay position over the blue fishing bar
- **Devil fruit not detected**: Check OCR setup and drop area positioning
- **Auto-purchase failing**: Verify all 4 purchase points are set correctly
- **High CPU usage**: Use silent mode and disable verbose logging

### Devil Fruit Issues

- **Fruits not being stored**: Check if OCR detected the fruit in console logs
- **Storage sequence running without fruit**: Ensure OCR is working properly
- **Wrong inventory slot**: Verify fruit key setting matches your setup
- **Rod not switching back**: Check rod key and bait point configuration

### Performance Issues

- **Long sessions lagging**: Use `run_silent.bat` for better performance
- **Console spam**: Disable "Verbose Console Logging" in settings
- **Memory usage**: Silent mode automatically reduces memory footprint
- **OCR slow**: Ensure Tesseract is properly installed for faster text recognition

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase has been refactored into a clean, modular structure:

```
src/
├── main.py              # Application entry poi
├── gui.py               # Main GUI and UI components
├── fishing.py           # Fishing bot logic and devil fruit detection
├── overlay.py           # Overlay window management
├── layout_manager.py    # Layout switching and area management
├── zoom_controller.py   # Auto zoom control system
├── ocr_manager.py       # OCR text recognition for devil fruits
├── webhook.py           # Discord webhook integration
├── updater.py           # Auto-update system
